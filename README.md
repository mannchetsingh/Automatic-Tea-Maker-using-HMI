# Automatic-Tea-Maker-using-HMI

**Automatic Tea Maker Using Human-Machine Interface (HMI)**

In this innovative project, we have developed an automatic tea maker that caters to user preferences through a Graphical User Interface (GUI) created using the **GUIDE software** in **MATLAB**.

**Components Utilized:**
1. Arduino UNO
2. 12V DC 5000RPM pump
3. L1298n Motor Driver
4. Connecting Wires
5. Pipes
6. Small motor

**Functionality:**
1. The initial display on the screen presents the user with the option to select their desired water level.
2. Following this, the user can choose between two types of tea: Green Tea or Black Tea, with tea bags being the medium of infusion.
3. Upon pressing the start button, it is essential to ensure that a cup is appropriately positioned.
4. Activating the start button initiates the pump, drawing hot water from a kettle.
5. Two pipes facilitate the transfer of hot water – one at the suction end and the other at the release end – ensuring precise water filling into the cup.
6. Subsequently, tea bags are dispensed using a specially designed ramp.
7. The system incorporates a storage mechanism akin to a vending machine for housing the tea bags.
8. The inclined ramp facilitates the seamless delivery of the tea bag into the cup.
9. With the tea bag now in place, users have the option to add sugar.
10. Recognizing that sugar preferences vary, we've incorporated a platform with an attached motor.
11. Activating the sugar button on the GUI engages the motor, dispenses sugar, and employs the inclined ramp for precise delivery.
12. The result is a meticulously prepared, hot, and refreshing cup of tea tailored to individual preferences.

This project not only showcases technological ingenuity but also exemplifies user-centric design, providing a delightful and customized tea-making experience.
